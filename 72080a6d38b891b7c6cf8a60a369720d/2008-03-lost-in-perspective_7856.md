 Jantar Mantar in New Delhi is a natural observatory that was built in the 18th century to prepare astronomical tables and calculate time based on the movement of the sun. It can be used to estimate time of day to a fairly accurate degree even today. For a photographer this is a pretty exciting building. It's maze like design offers ample opportunities to capture the interplay of angles and spaces.
